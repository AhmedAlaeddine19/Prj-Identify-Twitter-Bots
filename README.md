# Prj-Identify-Twitter-Bots
-Help Twitter Identify Bots : 
     Online social networks (OSNs) have experienced exponential growth in the number of active members throughout time, and they now play a significant role in the shaping of public opinion. As a result, there is now a lot of concern about the use of bots and botnets to distribute false information on OSNs. The most notable instance of this occurred during the 2016 American Presidential Elections, when Russian bots on Twitter spread false information to sway the outcome of the vote.

-Objectif: 
     The goal of this project is to identify Twitter bot profiles by combining Benford's Law with different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers. The project also covers numerous statistical techniques that are employed to confirm the classification outcomes.
